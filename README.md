- Unity version 2021.3.23f1
- This game prototype was made in roughly 1.5h
On a planet that was hit by a large asteroid inhabited by a futuristic civilization of robots many years ago, you are part of the surviving leftovers of humanity, now located underground to hide from the invaders.
As one of the most important members of society, you are operating the train company “Onyx Steam & Co” that transports cargo from place to place to provide supplies to all remaining survivors.
However, your train must move above ground to operate and there, you are attacked by the Hard Hats, robotic cowboys trying to take down your train to cut off humanity’s last supply chain.
While on the train, you must defend it from robots using a [Revolver] and keep refueling the furnace to keep your train running until a certain amount of time has passed.
Whenever you arrive at a station, you can repair and upgrade your train and prepare for the train’s next departure.
